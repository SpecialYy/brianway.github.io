# My modification

- delete some useless dirs
- create "_data" dir to store my personal infomation,not in the "_config.yml"
- change the "static/css/index.css":`width: 95px;`,like below,solving long-words-unfitting in nav bar.

```css
.navbar-nav li{
	min-width: 95px;
	text-align: center;
}
```

- add navbar such as "Archive" and "Links",the data in "Links" page also loaded from "_data" dir.
